# About this project

This website gathers a series of projects developed during my undergraduate studies, focusing on the **computational simulation of physical systems**. The main goal is to make available:

- Interactive simulators that can be run directly in the browser  
- Theoretical explanations of the physical models involved  
- Well-documented and reusable source code

The simulations were implemented using **Python** and the **Godot Engine**, aiming to explore both the physical behavior and the computational visualization of the systems modeled.

# Available simulators

- [Damped Pendulum](./simulators/damped_pendulum.html)  
- [Coupled Mass-Spring System](./simulators/coupled_springs.html)  
- [Oscillating Rings](./simulators/oscillating_rings.html)  
- [Dancing Flames](./simulators/dancing_flames.html)  
- [Projectile with Spring](./simulators/projectile_spring.html)  
- [Inclined Plane with Ball](./simulators/inclined_plane.html)

Each simulation is accompanied by a brief theoretical description and the corresponding implementation. In some cases, the source code is available for download or direct access.
