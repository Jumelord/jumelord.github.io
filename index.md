# About this project

This website gathers a series of projects developed during my undergraduate studies, focusing on the **computational simulation of physical systems**. The main goal is to make available:

- Interactive simulators that can be run directly in the browser  
- Theoretical explanations of the physical models involved  
- Well-documented and reusable source code

The simulations were implemented using **Python** and the **Godot Engine**, aiming to explore both the physical behavior and the computational visualization of the systems modeled.

## [Coupled Mass-Spring System](./simulators/coupled_springs.html)  
## [Oscillating Rings](./simulators/oscillating_rings.html)  
## [Dancing Flames](./simulators/dancing_flames.html)  
## [Projectile with Spring](./simulators/projectile_spring.html)
